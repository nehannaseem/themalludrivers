## Introduction

Self-driving cars have become a hot topic in recent years due to their potential to revolutionize transportation. These cars can navigate and operate without human input, using a combination of sensors, cameras, and sophisticated algorithms. In order to build a self-driving car, various technologies such as machine learning, computer vision, and robotics are employed.

One such technology that can be used to create a self-driving car is Arduino. Arduino is an open-source electronics platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software. It allows you to create interactive objects and projects that can sense and control the physical world.

Using an Arduino board, you can build a self-driving car that can sense its environment, make decisions, and drive on its own. The car can be equipped with a range of cameras such as  2 that can detect obstacles and other objects in its path. It can also use machine learning algorithms to analyze and process data from these camera to make intelligent decisions.

In this documentation, we will provide a step-by-step guide on how to build a self-driving car using Arduino. We will cover everything from selecting the right components to assembling and programming the car. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced electronics enthusiast, this guide will help you build your very own self-driving car using Arduino.

The vehicle is a custom-designed robot with the ability to navigate an obstacle course using a combination of sensors and motors. The robot consists of a 3D-printed chassis that houses an Arduino and a breadboard in the center. The robot also has three ultrasonic sensors, one in the front and two on each side, and a PIXY2 camera mounted on top of the chassis. The robot uses a combination of the sensors and camera to detect obstacles and navigate the course. The robot is powered by a Lithium-ion battery with a step-down module for regulating voltage. The robot has two motors, a Lego medium motor at the back with a differential gear. Differential gear is used to allow the wheels to rotate at different speeds while still transmitting torque to both wheels. This is particularly useful for vehicles that turn or maneuver in tight spaces, as it allows the wheels on the outside of a turn to rotate faster than the wheels on the inside.  The DC motor is connected to the rear wheels with the help of a motor driver and the motor driver helps in controling the speed. The axle connector is used to connect the servo motor to the front wheels. These components work together to allow the vehicle to detect obstacles, navigate through them, and complete the obstacle course. We have used the Ackermann steering system it is a type of steering mechanism commonly used in vehicles, which is designed to provide better turning radius and improved steering geometry. It works by having the front wheels turn at different angles during a turn, allowing for the inside wheel to turn at a sharper angle than the outside wheel. This helps reduce tire scrub and improves the overall stability and handling of the vehicle. In this project, the Ackermann steering system is implemented using a servo motor and an axle connector to rotate the front wheels at different angles.


Adding on our robotics project involves several engineering principles such as speed, torque, and power, which are critical to ensuring the proper function and performance of the robot.

* Speed is a measure of how fast your robot can move, and it is determined by the speed of the motors driving the wheels. In this project, we have selected LEGO Medium DC motors, the speed of a LEGO Medium DC Motor can vary depending on the voltage applied and the load on the motor. At its maximum rated voltage of 9 volts, the motor has a no-load speed of approximately 380 revolutions per minute (RPM). However, this speed can be reduced when the motor is under load or when a lower voltage is applied. The speed of the motor can also be controlled using a motor controller or by adjusting the input voltage. The speed of the robot will depend on the gearing and wheel size used in the design, as well as other factors such as friction and weight.

* Torque is a measure of the twisting force produced by the motor, and it is essential for driving the robot's wheels. The torque of your motors determines how much force they can exert on the wheels, which in turn affects the robot's ability to move and carry loads. In our project, we have selected step-down module, which can regulate the voltage and current flowing to the motors, ensuring that they receive a consistent supply of power.

* Power is a measure of the rate at which energy is transferred, and it is essential for driving the motors and other components of your robot. The power output of your motors determines how much work they can perform, and it is directly proportional to the product of torque and speed. In this project, we have selected the L298N motor driver, which can control the speed and direction of the motors by varying the voltage and current supplied to them.

Overall, the engineering principles of speed, torque, and power are critical to the proper function and performance of your robot. By selecting motors, drivers, and other components that are matched to the requirements of your design, you can ensure that your robot will move efficiently and accurately, while also providing the power and torque necessary to perform its intended tasks.

## Power Source

One of the most critical aspects of any mobile robotics project is the power source. For this project, we have selected 2 LI-ion batteries with a capacity of 3.7 volt, which is capable of providing the required voltage and current to power the motors, sensors, and other components on the vehicle. To maximize battery life, we have carefully selected sensors that consume minimal power while still providing the necessary data to help the vehicle negotiate different challenges. These sensors include the PIXY 2 camera for visual recognition, the HC SRO4 ultrasonic sensor for distance measurement, and the MUGOSO gyroscope and accelerometer for motion tracking. We have also included a MG90 servo motor to actuate the camera and a step-down module to regulate voltage levels. To ensure reliable and efficient operation, we have designed a professional wiring diagram that includes all components and connections, as well as a comprehensive BOM that details each component and its specifications. With this approach, we can be confident that our vehicle will operate safely, reliably, and efficiently.

## How we overcame obstacles
To navigate the obstacle course, we have implemented a combination of vision-based navigation and ultrasonic sensing. The PIXY 2 camera provides real-time video feedback that is processed by an onboard computer running custom software developed using Aurdino programming language. The software detects and tracks obstacles in the path of the vehicle, calculates their position and size, and generates a path plan to avoid them. The HC SRO4 ultrasonic sensor is used to provide distance information and adjust the vehicle's speed accordingly. To ensure efficient and reliable operation, we have designed the software using a modular approach, with each module responsible for a specific task. We have also included comprehensive comments and documentation in the source code to aid in understanding and future development. The software is executed on an Arduino UNO microcontroller, which controls the various motors and servos that actuate the vehicle's movement and camera positioning. We have designed flow diagrams and pseudo code to aid in understanding the software logic and to facilitate debugging and modification. With this approach, we can be confident that our vehicle will effectively negotiate the obstacle course and complete the assigned tasks.
